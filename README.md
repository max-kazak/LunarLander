# Lunar Lander
This repository (https://github.gatech.edu/mkazakov3/RL_P2) contains code for second project of Reinforcement Learning class.

## Environment
To run this code one has to create _python 3_ environment with following libraries:

_numpy, matplotlib, tensorflow, jupyter, gym_

## Execution
To reproduce the results one can run in the terminal with created environment: _jupyter notebook_

After that open DQN.ipynb file in jupyter web interface and run all cells.

All graphs, results mentioned in the report can be found in this notebook as well as implementation of the reinforcement learning agent.

Also _checkpoints_ folder contains saved tensorflow environments, so anyone can skip agent training step and proceed stright to testing stage.
